### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Abraham and I am new to the world of coding and a currently learning backend engineering with BloomTech! Currently Java is the technology I have the most interest in, and I also greatly enjoy realm of Amazon Web Services connecting to backend code via DynamoDB, Lambda, and the API Gateway. I may be looking for help with front end technolgoies to bridge the gap!

Feel free to ask me anything about myself! Some facts about me are: 
- My pronouns are he/him. 
- Cat person all the way.
- I enjoy being active.
- I like to watch shows and animes! Any recommendations?
